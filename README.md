# Advanced-Shortest-Paths

This project was a part of the specialization course in algorithms on graphs. It involves the successful
implementation of fast shortest path finding algorithms like Double Dijkstra, A* search and Contraction
Hierarchies on complex graphs having millions of nodes and edges representing real life road networks.
